:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Interactive Map**

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
The interactive map in the Explore feature is a key component for visualizing culvert data. Here's how to navigate and use it:

-   **Zoom for Details:** At higher zoom levels, the map displays counts of culverts to manage the density of information. As you zoom in, individual culverts are revealed, allowing for more detailed examination.

-   **Click for Information:** Clicking on a culvert once it's visible on the map brings up a callout with culvert data such as the WDFW site ID number, passability, potential fish species, and estimated habitat and construction cost.

-   **Filtering for Focus:** Utilize the dropdown menus to select culverts within specific WRIAs, HUC-12s, and ownership types. This tailors the map to show only the data relevant to your interests.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Submit**

Without additional selections (see below), clicking "Submit" will provide two products:

1.  A map highlighting, in blue, barrier(s) that are estimated to unlock the most habitat for the user defined budget. selections here are based on [Recent research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320722002634) on regional repair costs, and uniform habitat quality.

<p align="center">

<img src="images/suggest_map.jpg" style="width: 80%; border: 1px solid black; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>

</p>

2.  A report, matching projects on the map, that provides the summed habitat by fish species (if known), that is estimated to be repaired, along with estimated cost per barrier id within the plan.

<p align="center">

<img src="images/suggest_report.jpg" style="width: 80%; border: 1px solid black; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>

</p>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Already Planned / Will Complete**

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
In addition to spatial and administrative constraints, users can pass new information and customization to their Suggest analysis. The Already Planned / Will Complete field allows users to include the IDs of culverts they have either recently completed (but passibility is not reflected in the apps data), or have planned and budgeted for those repairs separately. In either case, including the culvert will remove the cost of its repair in the analysis, assume it is now passable, and suggest additional barriers within the users budget as before. Additionally, the added Planned/Completed culverts will be shown as associated habitat in the map but ignored in the new report.
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/suggest_complete.jpg)
:::
:::

Note: If you don't know the culvert id, but know their physical locations, simply navigate to those points on the map, click, and copy/paste the id from their call out into the Already Planned / Will Complete field.Once added, click the submit button again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Example Results**

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
Map Results:

Including the two culverts to the southwest as already planned / completed, and leaving budget the same, suggests a new third culvert to the northeast, the map indicates potential habitat gains in blue with areas that will remain blocked in red.

Report Results:

Only the unlocked habitat and cost of the new suggestion is given. Note that this particular stream had no species listed, but still reports the total linial gain.

<img src="images/suggest_report_planned.jpg" style="width: 90%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Habitat Quantity Definition**

Habitat quantity is a critical metric in environmental assessment and can be quantified in terms of length, area, or volume. By default, length is used as the primary measure.

<img src="images/suggest_hab_select.jpg" style="width: 60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>

*Note:* For area and volume calculations, bankfull width and depth are utilized as outlined in [Bieger et al. 2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jawr.12282).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Objective**

The Objective feature in Upstream provides a more comprehensive analysis of habitat quality. When selecting 'Weighted Attributes', the system incorporates various habitat quality metrics, building upon the chosen Habitat Quantity Metric.

This feature allows users to assign weights to different land use types within a 100-meter buffer surrounding the habitat. These land use categories, derived from the [National Landcover Dataset](https://www.mrlc.gov/data), include urban, agricultural, and natural areas. This weighting system enables users to make localized assessments of habitat quality based on land use.

Additionally, the 'Ideal Habitat Temperature' option allows users to factor in temperature conditions, further refining the habitat quality analysis. For simplicity, August mean temperature is considered as it is a proxy for the max average monthly temperatures anadromous species are likely to encounter. The temperature values are pulled from the NHDplusV2 and have been computed using a grid which combined the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model data [PRISM](http://www.prismclimate.org) for the period between 1971 and 2000 [Documentation](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-04/NHDPlusV2_User_Guide.pdf). Missing temperature values were interpolated using IDW with n.max = 10 while also including bank full width.

<img src="images/suggest_objective.jpg" style="width: 60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Cost**

In the Cost section of Upstream, users have the flexibility to input specific financial details for their projects. This feature is particularly useful for those who have precise cost information at their disposal. Cost estimates were initially established using methods described in [**Van Deynze et al 2022**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320722002634). As these were 2019 costs, CPI is considered and used to adjust the estimates to the current year for inflation. Unknown costs are spatially interpolated using IDW.

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
-   **Provide Mean Project Cost:** Users can enter the average cost of either the design phase or the construction phase of their culvert projects. This input is invaluable for those who have detailed, project-specific financial data.

-   **Default Modelled Cost Estimates:** For users without specific cost data, Upstream offers a default option that utilizes modelled cost estimates. These estimates are based on a comprehensive analysis of regional data and provide a reliable approximation for project budgeting.
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
<img src="images/suggest_cost.jpg" style="width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
:::
:::

This dual approach to cost estimation ensures that users can tailor the financial aspects of their habitat restoration plans according to the level of detail they have, ensuring both accuracy and flexibility in project planning.

-   Temperature data utilized in our application are derived from the NHDPlusV2 dataset as the August Mean Temperatures in Celsius. The choice of August data is strategic, as it likely represents the maximum average monthly temperatures that anadromous species might encounter. These temperature values are sourced from the PRISM Climate Group ([\<http://www.prismclimate.org>](http://www.prismclimate.org/)) for the period spanning 1971 to 2000. For a comprehensive understanding of the attributes in NHDPlusV2, please refer to the [NHDPlusV2 User Guide](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-04/NHDPlusV2_User_Guide.pdf). In cases where temperature data were missing, we applied Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation, with a maximum neighbor count of 10, incorporating the bankfull width of water bodies.

-   Land use data is derived from the [National Landcover Dataset](https://www.mrlc.gov/data), specifically the 2021 version, offering insights into the surrounding environments of habitats. These land types, following the [Anderson Land Cover Classification System](https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/0964/report.pdf) are further simplified assigning classes 81 and 82 to "agriculture" and classes 21, 22, and 23 to "urban". All remaining classes then become categorized as "natural".
